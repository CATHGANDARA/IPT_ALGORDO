    <p>  Hi! I'am Cathyrine you can call me Cath do you agree with me that I have a beautiful name? sometimes it's annoy me if people misspelled my name I found my own name as unique HAHAHA I'm currently college student and still wondering why I'm in IT field and it's make me cry when I remember my decision. I will pour my unsaid thoughts and feelings here even though no one is care at least it is escape from its own prison. I am so proud of myself because it's not turning back how am I back then the weak one even though things really made me sick and ick even the flow are too strong to stand it still keep following its own feet making own decision and become a strong version of Cathyrine. You know what, I want to be a singer artist besides of my being art artistic I want to be singer too hoping someday I become a famous artist in the things that I really want to do also hoping that I would help my family in my passion I want them to be happy in my own decisions, passion and to those things that I love to do. there's a lot of thing that I want to share but maybe I should keep these it is better to not to know and better to keep along with me. Thank you for listening hope you're doing well.</p>
